# Rock-paper-Scissors

This project was a JavaScript-based rock-paper-
scissors website where users can play against
the computer. Utilize HTML for structure, CSS for
styling, and JavaScript for game logic and
interactivity. The site will offer a seamless user
experience with clear instructions and
responsive design for various devices.
